See how Evidence you have enough money for your stay If the document checklist requires you to provide evidence of your financial capacity, you must attach evidence with your visa application. If you don’t provide this evidence, we may refuse your application without asking you for more information. If the document checklist does not require you to provide evidence of your financial capacity, we may still ask you to provide this evidence while we are processing your application. The living cost we ask you to declare and provide with your visa application is the minimum amount of money you need for the purpose of the visa. Actual living costs vary throughout Australia and may be much higher than what you need for the visa. We recommend you research the area you intend to live in, including the cost of living in that area. For more information on evidence of financial capacity, see the Federal Register of Legislation - Migration (LIN 19/198: Evidence of financial capacity—Subclass 500 Visa and Subclass 590 Visa) Instrument 2019 Evidence that you have enough money for your stay can include: deposits of money from a financial institution a government loan or loans from a financial institution scholarships or similar financial support. Annual income Alternatively, you can provide evidence that your parents or your partner had a personal annual income of at least AUD87,856 in the 12 months immediately before you apply. If you bring family members, your parents’ or partner’s income must be at least AUD102,500 in the 12 months immediately before you apply. If both your parents are working we can consider their combined income. Provide evidence of your parents’ or partner’s income in the form of official government documents such as tax assessments less than 12 months old. We won’t accept bank statements or direct evidence from an employer. Work out how much money you need for the visa At a minimum, you must have enough money to pay for: your travel 12 months of your course fees (or pro rata fees, if your course is less than 12 months) 12 months of living costs for you and any family members who come with you to Australia (or pro rata fees, if you are staying less than 12 months) school fees for any school-age children who accompany you (or pro rata fees, if the child will be at school for less than 12 months). Use the following information to work out how much money you need for the visa. To calculate pro rata costs, divide the annual cost by 365 and multiply the result by the number of days you intend to stay in Australia. Living costs 12-month living costs are for: students - AUD29,710 partners coming with you - AUD10,394 a child coming with you - AUD4,449. Course fees Use the first 12 months of your course fees. If your course is 12 months or less, use the total cost. Deduct any costs you have already paid – you must provide evidence you have paid them, such as a receipt or Confirmation of Enrolment. If you are in Australia and your course has already started, calculate the course fee for 12 months starting on the date you lodge your application. Example 1: your course fee is AUD50,000 for 3 years. The fee for 12 months is the total course cost divided by the number of years you will be studying. AUD50,000 divided by 3 years = AUD16,666, less any amount you have already paid if relevant. Example 2: your course fee is AUD15,000 for 10 months and you have already paid AUD5,000. Deduct the amount you have already paid from the total amount. AUD15,000 - AUD5,000 = AUD10,000. Example 3: your course fee is AUD20,000 for 18 months. The fee for 12 months is the total divided by the total number of months, then multiplied by 12. (AUD20,000/18) x 12 = AUD13,333. Deduct any costs you have already paid. Schooling costs If you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling costs of at least AUD13,502 per year for each child. Costs vary between states, territories and schools in Australia. You are responsible for finding out how much the child’s schooling will cost. You don’t have to provide evidence of schooling costs if you: are a PhD student and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived, or have received an Australian Commonwealth Government scholarship, including Foreign Affairs and Defence sponsored students, and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees have been waived.
