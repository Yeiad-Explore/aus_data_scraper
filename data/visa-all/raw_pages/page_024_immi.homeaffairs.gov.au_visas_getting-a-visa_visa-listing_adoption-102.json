The adoption must be by an Australian citizen, an eligible New Zealand citizen or the holder of an Australian permanent visa. They must have been residing outside Australia for more than 12 months immediately before lodging the visa application. For further information on adopting a child see Intercountry Adoptions Australia .​​ Children adopted under the Hague Adoption Convention Details A child may be eligible for Australian Citizenship if the intercountry adoption is: finalised outside Australia under the Hague Convention, or a recognised bilateral arrangement. If we grant the child Australian citizenship they can enter Australia on an Australian passport and will not need to apply for a visa. For further information see Become an Australian citizen (by adoption) Expatriate adoptions Details Australian Government has no role The Australian Government, including the Department of Home Affairs, has no role in the overseas expatriate adoption process. The Australian Government, including our Department, does not provide documents that support or endorse expatriate adoptions overseas. This includes letters of support or certificates of no objection. If an overseas authority asks you to obtain a document of support for an expatriate adoption, you can advise them to email info@intercountryadoption.gov.au We only assess and decide adoption visa applications. A visa will only be granted if all eligibility requirements are met. Eligibility requirements for expatriate adoptees entering Australia If the child is adopted through an expatriate adoption, and you (the adoptive parent) are considering bringing them to Australia, then, amongst other criteria, all of the following must be met: at least one adoptive parent must have resided outside Australia for more than 12 months immediately before lodging a visa application the adoptive parent must not have resided overseas to avoid Australia’s intercountry adoption laws the adoptive parent must have full and permanent parental rights (no remaining legal ties between the child and the birth parents can exist) the adoption must adhere to adoption laws of the home country. Seek legal advice If a child has been legally adopted in an overseas country (not Australia) under that country's law, it does not guarantee that the overseas adoption will meet the requirements of an Adoption (Subclass 102) visa. We recommend you obtain independent legal advice both in Australia and in the child’s country of usual residence before proceeding with an expatriate adoption. Have a sponsor Details The child must be sponsored by an eligible adoptive parent or prospective adoptive parent. We must approve the sponsorship before the visa can be granted. If the sponsor and/or their spouse or de facto partner (if any) have a pending registrable offence charge, we will refuse the sponsorship and visa application. If the sponsor and/or their spouse or de facto partner (if any) have a registrable offence conviction, we can only approve the sponsorship in very limited circumstances. Learn more about measures for the protection of children Be this age The child must be under 18 at the time of adoption, when the application is submitted and when we make our decision. Meet the health requirement Details The child and any dependent child who applies for the visa with them must meet our health requirement If we can consider a health waiver for an adoption visa applicant, we will examine your circumstances carefully. Learn more about health waivers Family members who are not coming to Australia might also have to meet our health requirement. Meet the character requirement If the child is aged 16 years or older they must meet our character requirement We might also ask that any other dependent child who applies for the visa meet the requirement.
